## Project Rankings

I am interested in the following projects (roughly in order of interest):

### 1. [Open Street Maps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page)
Project to create free editable map (and geographic data) of the world.

### 2. [Open Census](https://opencensus.io/)
Libraries that provide metrics collection and tracing for services.

### 3. [Open MRS](https://openmrs.org/)
Open source enterprise electronic medical record system platform.

### 4. [Open States](https://openstates.org/)
Python scrapers that make raw data about state legislative activities available as JSON API.

### Honorable Mention -
(CHAOSS's Augur)[https://github.com/chaoss/augur] is a Python library and web service for GitHub health and sustainability metrics. I really like the idea, however, I now realize that it does not really meet the "Humanitarian" criteria for HFOSS.
