[CIVICRM](https://civicrm.org/) - constituent relationship management software


| Evaluation Factor          | Level (0-2)  | Evaluation Data / Comments |
|---|---|---|
| __Licensing__              |      2 | [CiviCRM 2.x and later codebase](https://civicrm.org/license) - GNU AGPL3 and CiviCRM Licensing Exception                |
| __Language__               |      1 | [CiviCRM Core App and Framework](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core): PHP (78.4%), JavaScript (1.9%)   CiviCRM allows devs to contribute through writing extensions and contributing to the core application and framework. Contributing to Core seems mostly [reserved to the core team](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/core/hacking/). These are the ratios for the "Core App and Framework" repo, however, the ratio seems generally similar across extensions (hope you like PHP!). |
| __Level of Activity__      |      2| CiviCRM Core App and Framework - Since 2018 started, the commits/week has ranged from 17 (Sep. 9) to 58 (Jul. 1) commits/week (not including week of 9/18).   CiviCRM Extensions - Searching "CiviCRM Extension" on GitHub and sorting by "Recently Updated" there were 3 extensions updated on 9/18, 3 extensions updated on 9/17, and 3 extensions updated on 9/16.   You can also contribute to [working groups](https://civicrm.org/teams/development-team) on the CiviCRM team, but other than translation it's hard to tell how active the other teams are.|
| __Number of Contributors__ |      2| CiviCRM Core App and Framework: 298 Contributors.   CiviCRM Extensions: 362 extensions listed on CiviCRM site, 478 repository results for "CiviCRM Extension" query on GitHub|
| __Product Size__           |      1| There is a lot of code (162.3 MB!) on the Core App, might prefer working on smaller extensions.|
| __Issue Tracker__          |      2| 191 open issues   208 closed issues   Fifth Issue Opened (on Core): September 14 (4 days ago from 9/18)   Seems that issues are actively being added/resolved.   Uses [GitLab](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues) for issue tracking.|
| __New Contributor__        |      2| Has development environment installation [instructions](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/tools/civibuild/), has a chat with a [channel specifically for newcomers](https://chat.civicrm.org/civicrm/channels/dev-newcomers) where questions have been asked/responded to within the past week, has a [stackexchange page](https://civicrm.stackexchange.com/) with 628 visitors per day, 83% of questions answered, questions asked in the last 5 hours have been answered. ["Get Involved"](https://civicrm.org/get-involved) section on their website includes instructions for getting started, with common opportunities for new contributors.|
| __Community Norms__        |      2| [CiviCRM Community Guidlines](https://civicrm.org/community-guidelines)   Code of Conduct: seems to emphasize valuing those who move project forward, CiviCRM has a roadmap to set their priorities as a project, emphasize encouraging debate and constructive criticism.    Observations about community exchanges: seem to be generally friendly to newcomers, does seem to be debate and disagreements over features between core team and others, did not notice any explicitly rude or harsh comments across chat, stackexchange, gitlab.|
| __User Base__              |      2| there are still people creating/modifying extensions for CiviCRM (at the time of writing there were individuals who had just updated their extensions) and there is a seemingly up-to-date list of more than 50 ["CiviCRM Experts"](https://civicrm.org/partners-contributors) who are organizations that use and support CiviCRM in some way.   [Instructions for adding/setting up software](https://civicrm.org/download), [User guide for software](https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest/), There are even [in-person trainings and webinars!](https://civicrm.org/events)|
| __Total Score__            |     16| Seems like a very active project with a strong userbase, however, the skill-celling for contributing to core seems pretty high, probably would have to contribute to documentation or [working groups](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/blob/master/GoogleSummerOfCode.md) |

| Evaluation Factor          | Level (0-2)  | Evaluation Data / Comments |
|---|---|---|
| __Licensing__              |      2| GNU General Public License v3.0|
| __Language__               |      2| Python (94.2% accross repositories), HTML, JavaScript|
| __Level of Activity__      |      2| Using most recently updated repo on GitHub [grimoirelab-sirmordred](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/graphs/commit-activity) as an example, majority of quarters in the past year have had at least 2 commits|
| __Number of Contributors__ |      2| Across repos, contributors range from 3-15|
| __Product Size__           |      1| [Main repo for the GrimoireLab software](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab) is 260.75 MB|
| __Issue Tracker__          |      1| Main repo for the GrimoireLab software has 26 open issues, 39 closed issues and the 5th issue opened Jun 4. Seems like responsiveness is mixed: two issues opened in the past 2 months have not been responded to at all|
| __New Contributor__        |      2| (across CHAOSS) Couldn't find instructions for setting up Dev Environment, however there is an IRC Channel, a weekly mailing list/group call (last email on mailing list sent Sept. 18th), and a ["Participate"](https://chaoss.community/participate) section on the website.|
| __Community Norms__        |      2| (across CHAOSS) ["Code of Conduct"](https://chaoss.community/about/code-of-conduct/) - specifically outlines unacceptable behaviors, outlines responsibilities for project maintainers to also maintain community norms, and provides specific ways to report any breaches in norms|
| __User Base__              |      2| CHAOSS held [CHAOSScon](https://chaoss.community/chaosscon-2018-na/) earlier in the year which highlighted use cases and featured workshops with software. GrimoireLab's website lists services built using GrimoireLab, has a [pretty extensive tutorial](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/) for new users. CHAOSS youtube channel also has [webinars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL60k37cxI-HTGcFML710hH7PeIcSLcyRf&v=3fsWApPoFQg) for GrimoireLab and Augur. |
| __Total Score__            |      16| I really like the idea of open source toolset, but size and lack of contributors makes it seem a little intimidating.|


[CHAOSS - augur](https://github.com/chaoss/augur) - Python library and web service for GitHub Health and Sustainability metrics


| Evaluation Factor          | Level (0-2)  | Evaluation Data / Comments |
|---|---|---|
| __Licensing__              |      2| MIT |
| __Language__               |      2| JavaScript (64.3%), HTML (19.1%), Python (4.5%)|
| __Level of Activity__      |      2| All quarters in past year have had majority committed weeks |
| __Number of Contributors__ |      2| 18 contributors|
| __Product Size__           |      2| 29.22 MB (manageable!)|
| __Issue Tracker__          |      2| augur repo has 25 open issues, 102 closed issues and the 5th issue opened 6 days from now (Sept. 18). Seems like team is generally pretty responsive, although they are the main ones posting issues! |
| __New Contributor__        |      2| (across CHAOSS) Couldn't find instructions for setting up Dev Environment, however there is an IRC Channel, a weekly mailing list/group call (last email on mailing list sent Sept. 18th), and a ["Participate"](https://chaoss.community/participate) section on the website.|
| __Community Norms__        |      2| (across CHAOSS) ["Code of Conduct"](https://chaoss.community/about/code-of-conduct/) - specifically outlines unacceptable behaviors, outlines responsibilities for project maintainers to also maintain community norms, and provides specific ways to report any breaches in norms|

CHAOSS youtube channel also has [webinars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL60k37cxI-HTGcFML710hH7PeIcSLcyRf&v=3fsWApPoFQg) for GrimoireLab and Augur. However, couldn't find too much about Augur users, web presence not quite as strong as GrimoireLab (which at least had a twitter account!) |
| __Total Score__            |      15| I really like the idea of metrics and the size of this project. Seems like if you really wanted to contribute, might be easier to be recognized for your contributions. However, I'm having a hard time finding web presence or a user base so might not be worthwhile if you really want to make a difference. |


[Carbon Footprint](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint) -  Google Chrome browser extension that displays carbon footprint info in Google Maps


| Evaluation Factor          | Level (0-2)  | Evaluation Data / Comments |
|---|---|---|
| __Licensing__              |      2| GNU General Public License v3.0 (according to README) |
| __Language__               |      2| JavaScript (~80%), HTML (~15%), CSS (~5%)|
| __Level of Activity__      |      1| Most recent quarter (July-Sept.) has not had majority-week commits|
| __Number of Contributors__ |      2| 26 contributors|
| __Product Size__           |      1| 137 MB |
| __Issue Tracker__          |      2| 20 open issues, 95 closed issues and the 5th issue opened 7 months from now (Feb. 21). In [most all open issues](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/issues), team has responded either with a affirmative comment, or mention in merge request or both, which makes me think that they are making changes based on issues but just aren't closing issues |
| __New Contributor__        |      1| Provides [instructions](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/blob/master/GoogleSummerOfCode.md) to apply for contributor role using a Google Summer of Code Grant, README asks you to contact developers if interested in contributing, other than that there is little to no instructions for new contributors|
| __Community Norms__        |      1| No code of conduct, however, behavior seen in issue messages are generally polite and helpful|
| __User Base__              |      2| 8,005 users on chrome, with 4.5/5 stars, instructions for installation and building is listed on README, instructional visual material is featured on the web store |
| __Total Score__            |     14 | I like the idea of contributing to a Chrome extension that is actively being used, however, it seems like the barrier to entry for new contributors is pretty high, and it hasn't been particularly active in the last 3 months |
