[CIVICRM](https://civicrm.org/) - constituent relationship management software


| Evaluation Factor          | Level (0-2)  | Evaluation Data / Comments |
|---|---|---|
| __Licensing__              |      2 | [CiviCRM 2.x and later codebase](https://civicrm.org/license) - GNU AGPL3 and CiviCRM Licensing Exception                |
| __Language__               |      1 | [CiviCRM Core App and Framework](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core): PHP (78.4%), JavaScript (1.9%)   CiviCRM allows devs to contribute through writing extensions and contributing to the core application and framework. Contributing to Core seems mostly [reserved to the core team](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/core/hacking/). These are the ratios for the "Core App and Framework" repo, however, the ratio seems generally similar across extensions (hope you like PHP!). |
| __Level of Activity__      |      2| CiviCRM Core App and Framework - Since 2018 started, the commits/week has ranged from 17 (Sep. 9) to 58 (Jul. 1) commits/week (not including week of 9/18).   CiviCRM Extensions - Searching "CiviCRM Extension" on GitHub and sorting by "Recently Updated" there were 3 extensions updated on 9/18, 3 extensions updated on 9/17, and 3 extensions updated on 9/16.   You can also contribute to [working groups](https://civicrm.org/teams/development-team) on the CiviCRM team, but other than translation it's hard to tell how active the other teams are.|
| __Number of Contributors__ |      2| CiviCRM Core App and Framework: 298 Contributors.   CiviCRM Extensions: 362 extensions listed on CiviCRM site, 478 repository results for "CiviCRM Extension" query on GitHub|
| __Product Size__           |      1| There is a lot of code (162.3 MB!) on the Core App, might prefer working on smaller extensions.|
| __Issue Tracker__          |      2| 191 open issues   208 closed issues   Fifth Issue Opened (on Core): September 14 (4 days ago from 9/18)   Seems that issues are actively being added/resolved.   Uses [GitLab](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues) for issue tracking.|
| __New Contributor__        |      2| Has development environment installation [instructions](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/tools/civibuild/)   Has a chat with a [channel specifically for newcomers](https://chat.civicrm.org/civicrm/channels/dev-newcomers) where questions have been asked/responded to within the past week.   Has a (stackexchange page)[https://civicrm.stackexchange.com/] with 628 visitors per day, 83% of questions answered, questions asked in the last 5 hours have been answered.   ("Get Involved")[https://civicrm.org/get-involved] section on their website includes instructions for getting started, with common opportunities for new contributors.|
| __Community Norms__        |      2| [CiviCRM Community Guidlines](https://civicrm.org/community-guidelines)   Code of Conduct: seems to emphasize valuing those who move project forward, CiviCRM has a roadmap to set their priorities as a project, emphasize encouraging debate and constructive criticism.    Observations about community exchanges: seem to be generally friendly to newcomers, does seem to be debate and disagreements over features between core team and others, did not notice any explicitly rude or harsh comments across chat, stackexchange, gitlab.|
| __User Base__              |      2| there are still people creating/modifying extensions for CiviCRM (at the time of writing there were individuals who had just updated their extensions) and there is a seemingly up-to-date list of more than 50 ["CiviCRM Experts"](https://civicrm.org/partners-contributors) who are organizations that use and support CiviCRM in some way.   [Instructions for adding/setting up software](https://civicrm.org/download)   User guide for software[https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest/)   There are even [in-person trainings and webinars!](https://civicrm.org/events)|
| __Total Score__            |     16|                 |

__TODO: break CHAOSS table below into tables for GrimoireLab and Augur software__

[CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/) - "CHAOSS community is developing metrics methodologies and software for expressing open source project health and sustainability"
* (hmm... but what about the health of CHAOSS itself!?...)
* created by the Linux Foundation
* community divided between:
  * [metrics committee](https://chaoss.community/metrics/) which establishes metrics for measuring community health
  * [software committee](https://chaoss.community/software/) which produces open source software analyzing software development
* In terms of software, the following two have been active in the past year:
  * GrimoireLab
  * Augur

| Evaluation Factor          | Level (0-2)  | Evaluation Data / Comments |
|---|---|---|
| __Licensing__              |      2| GNU General Public License v3.0|
| __Language__               |      2| Python (vast majority!), JavaScript, HTML (accross repositories).   Across repositories, seem to almost entirely use Python, however, the [repository HatStall uses 50.6% HTML](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-hatstall), the repository [augur uses 64.3% JavaScript](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-hatstall) and [grimoirelab-kibiter uses 90.5% JavaScript](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-kibiter)|
| __Level of Activity__      |      2| Using most recently updated repo on GitHub [grimoirelab-sirmordred](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/graphs/commit-activity) as an example, majority of quarters in the past year have had at least 2 commits|
| __Number of Contributors__ |      2| Across repos, contributors range from 5-181, however, there are generally 10-20 contributors in most repos.|
| __Product Size__           |      1| [Main repo for the grimoirelab software](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab) is 260.75 MB|
| __Issue Tracker__          |      1| Main repo for the grimoirelab software has 26 open issues, 39 closed issues and the 5th issue opened Jun 4. Seems like responsiveness is mixed: two issues opened in the past 2 months have not been responded to at all|
| __New Contributor__        |      2| Coudn't find instructions for setting up Dev Environment, however there is an IRC Channel, a weekly mailing list/group call (last email on mailing list sent Sept. 18th), and a ["Particpate"](https://chaoss.community/participate) section on the website.|
| __Community Norms__        |      2| ["Code of Conduct"](https://chaoss.community/about/code-of-conduct/) - specifically outlines unacceptable behaviors, outlines responsibilities for project maintainers to also maintain community norms, and provides specific ways to report any breaches in norms|
| __User Base__              |      2| CHAOSS held [CHAOSScon](https://chaoss.community/chaosscon-2018-na/) earlier in the year which highlighted use cases and featured workshops with software. GrimoireLab's website lists services built using GrimoireLab, has a [pretty extensive tutorial](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/) for new users. CHAOSS youtube channel also has [webinars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL60k37cxI-HTGcFML710hH7PeIcSLcyRf&v=3fsWApPoFQg) for GrimoireLab and Augur. |
