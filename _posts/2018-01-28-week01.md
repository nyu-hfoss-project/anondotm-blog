| Evaluation Factor          | Level (0-2)  | Evaluation Data / Comments |
|---|---|---|
| __Licensing__              |      2 | [CiviCRM 2.x and later codebase](https://civicrm.org/license) - GNU AGPL3 and CiviCRM Licensing Exception                |
| __Language__               |      1 | [CiviCRM Core App and Framework](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core): PHP (78.4%), JavaScript (1.9%)\nCiviCRM allows devs to contribute through writing extensions and contributing to the core application and framework. Contributing to Core seems mostly [reserved to the core team](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/core/hacking/). These are the ratios for the "Core App and Framework" repo, however, the ratio seems generally similar across extensions (hope you like PHP!). |
