| Evaluation Factor          | Level (0-2)  | Evaluation Data / Comments |
|---|---|---|
| __Licensing__              |      2 | [CiviCRM 2.x and later codebase](https://civicrm.org/license) - GNU AGPL3 and CiviCRM Licensing Exception                |
| __Language__               |      1 | [CiviCRM Core App and Framework](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core): PHP (78.4%), JavaScript (1.9%)   CiviCRM allows devs to contribute through writing extensions and contributing to the core application and framework. Contributing to Core seems mostly [reserved to the core team](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/core/hacking/). These are the ratios for the "Core App and Framework" repo, however, the ratio seems generally similar across extensions (hope you like PHP!). |
| __Level of Activity__      |      2| CiviCRM Core App and Framework - Since 2018 started, the commits/week has ranged from 17 (Sep. 9) to 58 (Jul. 1) commits/week (not including week of 9/18).   CiviCRM Extensions - Searching "CiviCRM Extension" on GitHub and sorting by "Recently Updated" there were 3 extensions updated on 9/18, 3 extensions updated on 9/17, and 3 extensions updated on 9/16.   You can also contribute to [working groups](https://civicrm.org/teams/development-team) on the CiviCRM team, but other than translation it's hard to tell how active the other teams are.|
| __Number of Contributors__ |      2| CiviCRM Core App and Framework: 298 Contributors.   CiviCRM Extensions: 362 extensions listed on CiviCRM site, 478 repository results for "CiviCRM Extension" query on GitHub|
| __Product Size__           |      1| There is a lot of code (162.3 MB!) on the Core App, might prefer working on smaller extensions.|
| __Issue Tracker__          |      2| 191 open issues   208 closed issues   Fifth Issue Opened (on Core): September 14 (4 days ago from 9/18)   Seems that issues are actively being added/resolved.   Uses [GitLab](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues) for issue tracking.|
| __New Contributor__        |      2| Has development environment installation [instructions](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/tools/civibuild/)   Has a chat with a [channel specifically for newcomers](https://chat.civicrm.org/civicrm/channels/dev-newcomers) where questions have been asked/responded to within the past week.   Has a (stackexchange page)[https://civicrm.stackexchange.com/] with 628 visitors per day, 83% of questions answered, questions asked in the last 5 hours have been answered.   ("Get Involved")[https://civicrm.org/get-involved] section on their website includes instructions for getting started, with common opportunities for new contributors.|
| __Community Norms__        |      2| [CiviCRM Community Guidlines](https://civicrm.org/community-guidelines)   Code of Conduct: seems to emphasize valuing those who move project forward, CiviCRM has a roadmap to set their priorities as a project, emphasize encouraging debate and constructive criticism.    Observations about community exchanges: seem to be generally friendly to newcomers, does seem to be debate and disagreements over features between core team and others, did not notice any explicitly rude or harsh comments across chat, stackexchange, gitlab.|
| __User Base__              |      2| there are still people creating/modifying extensions for CiviCRM (at the time of writing there were individuals who had just updated their extensions) and there is a seemingly up-to-date list of more than 50 ("CiviCRM Experts")[https://civicrm.org/partners-contributors] who are organizations that use and support CiviCRM in some way.   [Instructions for adding/setting up software](https://civicrm.org/download)   User guide for software[https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest/)   There are even (in-person trainings and webinars!)[https://civicrm.org/events]|
| __Total Score__            |     16|                 |
